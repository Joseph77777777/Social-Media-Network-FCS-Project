SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PROJECT

Overview:

This project will implement  a social network system.
The project will involve creating various classes and methods to manage users and relationships, connect with friends, make posts, and explore the network through various operations like searching for users, suggesting new friends, and visualizing the social network graph using the NetworkX library.
The system supports functionalities such as adding and removing users, following and unfollowing friends, posting updates, updating interests,and performing network analysis and recommendations..


Project Characteristics:

A-User Management:

1-Add a new user.\
2-Remove an existing user.\

B-Friends Management:

1-Follow a friend.\
2-Unfollow a friend.\
3-Display the list of friends.\

C-Content Management:

1-Post updates.\
2-Update interests.\

D-Network Operations:

1-Display network statistics (average number of friends, network density)
2-Search for users by name or ID
3-Sort users by name
4-BFS and DFS traversals
5-Find the shortest path between two users
6-Suggest new friends based on common interests
7-Visualize the social network graph

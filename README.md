SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PROJECT

Overview:

This project implements a social network system similar to popular platforms like Instagram and Twitter, where users can follow and unfollow each other. The system allows users to manage their connections, create posts, update their interests, and explore their social network through various functionalities.

Project Characteristics:

A-User Management:

1-Add a new user.\
2-Remove an existing user.\
3-Log in as an existing user.

B-Friends Management:

1-Follow a friend.\
2-Unfollow a friend.\
3-Display the list of friends.

C-Content Management:

1-Post updates.\
2-Update interests.

D-Network Operations:

1-Display network statistics (average number of friends per user, network density)\
2-Search for users by name using linear search algorithm or ID using binary search\
3-Sort users by name using selection sort algorithm\
4-BFS and DFS traversals to explore the social network structure\
5-Find the shortest path between two users using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm\
6-Suggest new friends based on common interests\
7-Visualize the social network graph using NetworkX and matplotlib


Application:

Menu:

The menu options before logging in are as follows:

0: Log in as an existing user\
1: Add a new user\
2: Remove an existing user\
16: Exit

The menu options for the logged in users are as follows:

0: Log in as an existing user\
1: Add a new user\
2: Remove an existing user\
3: Display network statistics\
4: Follow a friend\
5: Unfollow a friend\
6: Add a new post\
7: Add a new interest\
8: Show all users sorted by name\
9: Search for a user by name\
10: Search for a user by ID\
11: Perform BFS traversal\
12: Perform DFS traversal\
13: Find the shortest path between two users\
14: Suggest top 4 new friends based on common interests\
15: Visualize the graph\
16: Exit

Example:\
Here is an example of how to use the application:

1-Log in or Add a User:

Choose option 0 to log in if you have an existing user.\
Choose option 1 to add a new user by providing a user ID and full name.

After logging in:

2-Manage Friends:

Choose option 4 to follow a friend by providing their user ID and the weight/strength of the relationship.\
Choose option 5 to unfollow a friend by providing their user ID.

3-Post Updates and Interests:

Choose option 6 to add a new post.\
Choose option 7 to add a new interest.

4-Network Operations:

Choose option 3 to display network statistics.\
Choose option 8 to show all users sorted by name.\
Choose option 9 to search for a user by name.\
Choose option 10 to search for a user by ID.\
Choose option 11 or 12 to perform BFS or DFS traversal.\
Choose option 13 to find the shortest path between two users.\
Choose option 14 to suggest new friends based on common interests.\
Choose option 15 to visualize the social network graph.

5-Exit:

Choose option 16 to exit the application.
